# Loan-Prediction-Prediction
In this project I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle and imported it to my notebook. 

Then I converted categorical data to numerical one so I can implement my predictive model.

I trained my Support Vector Machine (SVM) and then evaluated the model which got an accuarcy level of 83%
